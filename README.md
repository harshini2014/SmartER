SmartER, the Smart Emergency Response System, is an intelligent emergency response and hospital routing platform designed to optimize patient transport decisions during medical emergencies. It operates in two modes: Public Mode for civilians and Pro Mode for ambulance services and hospitals. The system helps identify the most appropriate hospital based on medical needs, availability of resources, real-time location, and optimal routing, aiming to reduce response time, improve patient outcomes, and support informed decision-making. Many regions, particularly remote or underserved areas, face delayed or unavailable ambulance services, and individuals using private transport often lack guidance on which hospital is best suited for a specific emergency. Emergency responders and hospitals also require faster coordination tools to ensure patients reach facilities with sufficient capacity, specialized doctors, and appropriate equipment. smartER addresses these challenges by combining triage support, hospital resource matching, and intelligent routing.

In Public Mode, civilians receive immediate guidance during emergencies when ambulances are unavailable. Key features include symptom-based triage, where the system asks structured questions to estimate the likely condition; hospital matching, which identifies nearby hospitals based on medical specialization, bed availability, required equipment, and appropriate medical staff; best route navigation, which provides the most efficient route to the selected hospital; and SOS emergency support, allowing users to initiate an ambulance call, capture their location, and notify the hospital of an incoming patient.

Pro Mode supports professional emergency coordination for ambulance teams, first responders, and hospitals. Its features include structured clinical input, where first responders input patient details; resource-aware hospital selection, matching patients with hospitals that have required specialists, available beds, necessary equipment, and capacity to handle the case; real-time location integration to track patient and ambulance positions; optimized route guidance for the ambulance driver; and hospital pre-notification to prepare the receiving facility.

smartER also incorporates a hospital ranking system using a weighted scoring model that considers distance, travel time, bed availability, specialist availability, equipment availability, and emergency capacity. Each hospital is assigned a calculated suitability score, with the highest-ranked hospital clearly indicated through a color-coded status for rapid identification.

The core objectives of smartER are to reduce emergency response time, improve hospital resource utilization, enable data-driven hospital selection, enhance coordination between civilians, ambulances, and hospitals, and support better patient outcomes. The system’s capabilities include real-time geolocation tracking, symptom-based triage logic, hospital resource matching, live routing integration, pre-arrival hospital notifications, and role-based access for Public and Pro users. Future scope includes integration with national emergency systems, real-time hospital capacity dashboards, AI-assisted predictive triage models, regional and national deployment support, and data analytics for public health planning. Overall, smartER is a scalable smart emergency coordination platform designed to bridge the gap between emergency incidents and appropriate medical care by combining intelligent triage, hospital resource awareness, and optimized routing to support faster and more informed emergency decisions for both civilians and professionals.
