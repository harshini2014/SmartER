smartER  
Smart Emergency Response System 

Overview  
smartER is an intelligent emergency response and hospital routing platform designed to optimize patient transport decisions during medical emergencies.  
The system supports two operational modes:  
Public Mode for civilians  
Pro Mode for ambulance services and hospitals  
smartER assists in identifying the most appropriate hospital based on medical needs, availability of resources, real time location, and optimal routing. 
The goal is to reduce response time, improve patient outcomes, and support informed decision making during emergencies.

Problem Statement  
In many regions, particularly remote or underserved areas, ambulance services may be delayed or unavailable. 
Individuals with access to private transport often lack reliable guidance on which hospital is best equipped to handle a specific emergency.  
Additionally, emergency responders and hospitals require faster coordination tools to ensure patients are transported to facilities with sufficient capacity, specialized doctors, and appropriate equipment.  
smartER addresses these gaps by combining triage support, hospital resource matching, and intelligent routing.  

Public Mode  
Public Mode is designed for civilians who require immediate guidance during a medical emergency.  
This mode is intended for situations where ambulance services are unavailable or cannot be reached.  

Key Features  

Symptom Based Triage 
The application asks structured questions about the patient’s condition.  
If the medical problem is unknown, the system uses guided symptom questions to estimate the likely condition.  

Hospital Matching
The system identifies nearby hospitals based on  
Medical specialization relevant to the condition  
Availability of sufficient beds  
Availability of required equipment  
Availability of appropriate medical staff  

Best Route Navigation
Provides the most efficient route to the selected hospital based on real time location.  

SOS Emergency Support  
Allows users to initiate an emergency ambulance call when available.  
Automatically captures the user’s location.  
Notifies the selected hospital of an incoming patient.  

 Pro Mode  
Pro Mode is designed for ambulance teams, first responders, and hospitals.  
It supports professional emergency coordination and structured patient transfer decisions.  

 Key Features  

Structured Clinical Input
First responders input patient condition details directly into the system.  

Resource Aware Hospital Selection
Matches the patient with hospitals that have  
Required specialists  
Available beds  
Necessary medical equipment  
Capacity to handle the case  

Real Time Location Integration 
Automatically captures patient and ambulance location.  

Optimized Route Guidance 
Provides the ambulance driver with the fastest and most efficient route to the selected hospital.  

Hospital Pre Notification 
Sends advance notification to the receiving hospital to prepare for the incoming case.  

Hospital Ranking System  
smartER determines the most suitable hospital using a weighted scoring model.  
Factors considered may include  
Distance from incident location  
Travel time  
Bed availability  
Specialist availability  
Equipment availability  
Emergency capacity  
Each hospital is assigned a calculated suitability score.  
The highest ranked hospital is indicated clearly within the interface using a color coded status displayed next to the hospital name. This enables rapid visual identification of the optimal facility.  

 Core Objectives  
Reduce emergency response time  
Improve hospital resource utilization  
Enable data driven hospital selection  
Enhance coordination between civilians, ambulances, and hospitals  
Support better patient outcomes  

 System Capabilities  
Real time geolocation tracking  
Symptom based triage logic  
Hospital resource matching  
Live routing integration  
Pre arrival hospital notifications  
Role based access for Public and Pro users  

 Future Scope  

Integration with national emergency systems  
Real time hospital capacity dashboards  
AI assisted predictive triage models 
Regional and national deployment support  
Data analytics for public health planning  

 Conclusion  

smartER is a scalable smart emergency coordination platform designed to bridge the gap between emergency incidents and appropriate medical care.
By combining intelligent triage, hospital resource awareness, and optimized routing, the system aims to support faster and more informed emergency decisions in both civilian and professional settings.
